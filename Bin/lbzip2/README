lbzip2 is a parallel, SMP-based, bzip2-compatible compression utility.

lbzip2 compresses and decompresses files using a variation of BWT compression
stack. More information on this topic can be found in the ALGORITHM file.

lbzip2 uses Gnulib and its building and testing process is managed by the GNU
build system. For more information on building and installing lbzip2 see the
INSTALL file. For usage see the manual pages.
