The authors of lbzip2 would like to thank (in no particular order):

- Adam Maulis at ELTE IIG, for fruitful discussions; for inspiring them to
parallelize the bit-shifting part of the decompressor, thus rendering the
splitter fully IO-bound; for inspiring them to create the single-worker
decompressor; and also for letting them test on "opteron";

- Julian Seward for creating bzip and bzip2;

- Paul Sladen for his Wikipedia contributions on bzip2, eg.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bzip2#File_format, and for his pyflate test data
(http://www.paul.sladen.org/projects/pyflate/);

- Michael Thomas from Caltech HEP for allowing them to test the earlier
lbunzip2 on their Itanium 2 machines;

- Bryan Stillwell for testing and retesting lbzip2 on "superdome"; his results
inspired them to remove the bottleneck in the multiple-workers decompressor
that proved significant on many-core machines;

- Zsolt Bartos-Elekes and Imre Csatlos for sending test reports, see
http://lacos.hu/;

- Gabor Kovesdan for creating the FreeBSD port;

- Paul Wise for reporting a possible (but mostly harmless) "read access to a
trap representation" bug
(http://lists.debian.org/debian-mentors/2009/10/msg00470.html);

- Paolo Bonzini for discussing SIGPIPE/EPIPE behavior;

- Yuta Mori for creating divsufsort and porting it to support cyclic strings;

- Serhii Khilinich for helping with creation of lbzip2 logo and motivating
me to create lbzip2 web page;

They would also like to thank the Department of Electrical and Information
Engineering at the University of Oulu, for making available their invaluable
PROTOS Genome Test Suite c10-archive under the GPL.
