Changes in version 1.19:

The option '-l, --list' has been ported from lziprecover.

It is now an error to specify two or more different operations in the
command line (--decompress, --list or --test).

Compression time of option '-0' has been slightly reduced.

Decompression time has been reduced by 2%.

In test mode, lzip now continues checking the rest of the files if any
input file is a terminal.

Trailing data are now shown both in hexadecimal and as a string of
printable ASCII characters.
