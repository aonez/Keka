# Keka
The macOS file archiver.

## What to do here

- [Issues](https://github.com/aonez/Keka/issues) - look for open ones, [create](https://github.com/aonez/Keka/issues/new) a new one.
- [Wiki](https://github.com/aonez/Keka/wiki) - learn and share Keka knowledge.
- [Releases](https://github.com/aonez/Keka/releases) - download an specific version.

This repository is used mainly to take care of [Issues](https://github.com/aonez/Keka/issues) and have a collaborative [Wiki](https://github.com/aonez/Keka/wiki).

If you have a problem or a request just search the [Issues](https://github.com/aonez/Keka/issues) for similar ones or [create](https://github.com/aonez/Keka/issues/new) a new one.

If you'll like to chat and you think the [Issues](https://github.com/aonez/Keka/issues) section is not the right place, just head to the [Forum](http://forum.kekaosx.com).

Translators will have here the files to translate in the near future. Meanwhile, read the [instructions](http://www.kekaosx.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=5) and download the [files to be translated](http://sourceforge.net/projects/keka/files/Keka%20Translator.7z/download).

Also head to [Releases](https://github.com/aonez/Keka/releases) if you need a concrete version not found on the [Keka website](http://www.kekaosx.com).

### So, where is the source code
Sadly, the source code of Keka 1.0 and newer will be not public due some legal issues (this is one [of the reasons](http://trac.kekaosx.com/ticket/14)). Legal support is needed, if you can help the project with law force, please get in contact with @aonez or at info@kekaosx.com. Any help is welcome.

### Legacy info
Keka started in [SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/keka). It will be rarely updated and issues in the [Tickets](https://sourceforge.net/p/keka/_list/tickets) may be replied, but [Issues](https://github.com/aonez/Keka/issues) here is the main cannal.

Later on, thanks to [NETWORKREDUX](https://networkredux.com) and [Trac](https://trac.edgewall.org), the project gained its own [ticketing system](http://trac.kekaosx.com). Due to spam and speed issues, it will be used no more. No new users, no new tickets. Use [Issues](https://github.com/aonez/Keka/issues) instead.

There's also [some documentation](http://trac.kekaosx.com/wiki/Doc) in the Keka trac that will be transferred over time here in the [Wiki](https://github.com/aonez/Keka/wiki).
