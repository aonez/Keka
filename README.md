### So, where is the source code
Sadly, the source code of Keka 1.0 and newer will be not public due some legal issues (this is [one of the reasons](https://trac.keka.io/ticket/14)). Legal support is needed, if you can help the project with law force, please get in contact with @aonez or at info @ keka.io. Any help is welcome.

### Legacy info
Keka started in [SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/keka). It will be rarely updated and issues in the [Tickets](https://sourceforge.net/p/keka/_list/tickets) may be replied, but [Issues](https://github.com/aonez/Keka/issues) here is the main cannal.

Later on, thanks to [NETWORKREDUX](https://networkredux.com) and [Trac](https://trac.edgewall.org), the project gained its own [ticketing system](https://trac.keka.io). Due to spam and speed issues, it will be used no more. No new users, no new tickets. Use [Issues](https://github.com/aonez/Keka/issues) instead.

There's also [some documentation](https://trac.keka.io/wiki/Doc) in the Keka trac that will be transferred over time here in the [Wiki](https://github.com/aonez/Keka/wiki).
