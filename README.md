### So, where is the source code
Keka is not open source since Keka 1.0. There were some reasons for this decision (this is [one of the reasons](http://web.archive.org/web/20180615184129/http://trac.keka.io/ticket/14)) and there're no plans to open the code again.

### Legacy info
Keka started in [SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/keka). It will be rarely updated and issues in the [Tickets](https://sourceforge.net/p/keka/_list/tickets) may be replied, but [Issues](https://github.com/aonez/Keka/issues) here is the main channel.

Later on, thanks to [NETWORKREDUX](https://networkredux.com) and [Trac](https://trac.edgewall.org), the project gained its own [ticketing system](https://trac.keka.io). Due to spam and speed issues, it will be used no more. No new users, no new tickets. Use [Issues](https://github.com/aonez/Keka/issues) instead.

There's also [some documentation](https://trac.keka.io/wiki/Doc) in the Keka trac that will be transferred over time here in the [Wiki](https://github.com/aonez/Keka/wiki).
