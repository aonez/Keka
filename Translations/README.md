## Keka translation

- Fork this project.
- Choose your preferred lproj language ([en.lproj](en.lproj) in the main english version) and translate all the files inside.
- Don't forget to add yourself to the [credits](Common/Translators.html).
- You can check if your files are UTF-8 (and convert them if not) with the bundled `convert` script.
- Create a Pull request to send your translation.

## Web translation

- Inside the [web folder](Web) you can translate the website strings. Just use the `lang_en.php` and replace it with your language, i.e. `lang_de.php`.
- Don't forget to add yourself in the `$content_bottom_copying` (you can add a link).
