# What to translate

- Choose your prefered lproj language to start with (Base.lproj in the main english version) and translate all the files inside.
- There're a few [services](../Services/) that you can also translate. Inside each service Resources folder are the lproj.
- Don't forget to add yourself to the [credits](Common/Translators.html)

Any trouble just get in touch in the [Issues](https://github.com/aonez/Keka/issues) section.

Thanks a lot for your contribution!
