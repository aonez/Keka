# What to translate

- Choose your prefered lproj language ([Base.lproj](Base.lproj) in the main english version) and translate all the files inside.
- Don't forget to add yourself to the [credits](Common/Translators.html).


- You can check your files are UTF-8 (and convert them if not) with the bundled `convert` script.

Any trouble just get in touch in the [Issues](https://github.com/aonez/Keka/issues) section.

Thanks a lot for your contribution!
