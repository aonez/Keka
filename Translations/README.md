## Keka translation

- Choose your prefered lproj language ([Base.lproj](Base.lproj) in the main english version) and translate all the files inside.
- Don't forget to add yourself to the [credits](Common/Translators.html).
- You can check if your files are UTF-8 (and convert them if not) with the bundled `convert` script.

## Web translation

- Inside the [web folder](Web) you can translate the website strings. Just use the `lang_en.php` and replace it with your language, i.e. `lang_de.php`.
- Don't forget to add yourself in the `$content_bottom_copying` (you can add a link).
